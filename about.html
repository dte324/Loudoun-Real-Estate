			    <h3>A Project Caused by COVID-19</h3>
			    <p style="text-align:left;"> Late in spring 2020, I received a phone call that my internship would be canceled for the summer due to
				    concerns over the increasing severity of the COVID-19 outbreak. From that day on, I was determined to not let my summer go to
				    waste. 
				    <br>
				    <br>
				    <h4>Obtaining & Processing the Data</h4>
				    The project began as a simple regression project. I began by using Python's 
				    <a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/">Beautiful Soup</a> library to web scrape home listings off of a real
				    estate listings website. I initially began web scraping previously sold houses in Ashburn, Virginia, but subsequently decided that
				    the project's scope was too small, so I decided to expand my dataset to include recently sold houses in Sterling and Leesburg, Virginia.
				    This resulted in a collection of over 500 sold homes between the beginning of June to early July. 
				    <br>
				    <br>
				    The data wasn't ready to be modeled just yet. Many inconsistancies and discontinuities existed within the data. For example,
				    some realtors include the home's lot size in acres but others input it in square feet. Another example, high school information is
				    included for some listings but not others. In fact, I even saw a couple listings with incorrect high school information. This made
				    sense as several Loudoun neighborhoods have been redistricted several times over the past decade, but in order for my analysis to be accurate,
				    all of this needed to be corrected. A significant chunk of time was dedicated to cleaning the data and preparing it for model building.
				<br>
				    <br>	    
				<h4>Model Building</h4>
				    
				    
				    I did not initially intend to build this website. I was planning to apply my skills
				    in web scraping and regression to predict housing prices in a particular town. 
				    <br>
				    <br>
				    This project is larger than any other project I have completed thus far in my college career. I have spent signficant sums of
				    time and effort putting this together, but it is something I am proud of and I enjoyed doing.
				    
				    
				    Regression model building is an extremely powerful tool; however, with great power comes great responsibility. These models aren't
				an exact science. This process can be compared to the writing process. It can take a while to sequence your ideas, organize,
				draft, and revise. This is an iterative process which can take a while, and this can be said for supervised modeling building
				as well. <br> <br>
			
				The process begins by attempting to gather possible predictor variables. Consider the attributes which impact the price
				that a home sells for. Some of these could include number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and square feet. Undoubtably, there are
				certainly more factors than these three. Would a 1000 square foot apartment with 2 bedrooms cost the same in New York City and 
				Chicken, Alaska (a small remote town in Alaska with less than 100 people)? Probably not. This is why three different models were
				constructed for Ashburn, Sterling, and Leesburg. Despite being nearby towns, there remains a large variability in home prices.
				Homes of the same size and characteristics can sell at very different prices if they are in different locations. This is only
				the tip of the iceberg. 
				
				<br> <br>
				When you decide to place your home on the market, an appraiser would likely give you a price that they think your house is worth.
				They often do this by looking at nearby houses that are representative of your house in both size and condition.
				However, a computer can't go around your neighborhood and do this like a person can. This is where model building comes into play.
				The model looks at many houses in your area and uses this information to give an informed guess on what your house could sell for. Model 
				building can be applied to many areas other than real estate. For example, one could construct a model to predict how changes in advertising
				spending impacts revenue. Similarly, one could predict the lifespan of asphalt on a highway based on its thickness, quality, and composition.
				The possibilities are endless!
				</p>
				<h3>Does This Always Work?</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left;"> The short answer is no. Model building isn't an exact science, and it can be very challenging at times. Sometimes, the data can
				be mathematically transformed to provide a better fit, but other times it simply won't work. Oftentimes, a major reason of this
				has to do with the quality of the predictor variables. The variability of the response variable may not be fully accounted for.
				In the case of this project, it is almost impossible to accurately predict the price of every single house in the eastern half of
					Loudoun County. Most houses in major subdivisions are easy to predict since there are many other homes in the area which
					are representative of them. In the case of smaller developments with large, extravagant houses, the margin of error
					is much greater. If you think the prediction of your home price is off, ask yourself if your house is representative
					of other houses in the area. Maybe your house is on a significantly larger lot or the house is a unique historic house in
					Downtown Leesburg. Whatever the reason is, one must always remember that regression models aren't an exact science, but
					they do their best to capture the most amount of variability within the response variable.
